    "#### Purpose of PCA:\n",
    "    - Analysing a complex set of variables into its pricipal components.\n",
    "    - PCA OUTCOMES:\n",
    "        1. Reduce number of dimensions in data.\n",
    "        2. Show which features explain the most variance in the data.\n",
    "       \n",
    "#### Dimension reduction: \n",
    "    - helps visualise and understand complex datasets.\n",
    "    - can also act as a simpler data set for training data for ML algos.\n",
    "        1. Reduce dimensions then train ML algo on smaller data set. \n",
    "    - Helps reduce N features to a desired smaller set of components through a transformation.\n",
    "    - does not simply select a subset of features. \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Variance Explained:\n",
    "    - certain features are more important/have more explanatory power than other features.\n",
    "    - e.g. size of house more important than colour of house - size more important when calculating price. \n",
    "    - for unsupervised unlabelled data how can we determine feature 'importance'? \n",
    "        - Measure he proportion to which each feature accounts for dispersion in the data set. \n",
    "    - Principle component is a linear combination of original features.\n",
    "    - The more variance the original feature accounts for the more influence it has over the principle components.\n",
    "    - A single principal component can 'explain' some percentage of the original data:\n",
    "        - e.g. 90% of the variance explained by some PC (Principal component).\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - 100% of the variance in the data is explained by all the original features.\n",
    "    - trade off some of the explained variance for less dimensions.\n",
    "    - This can be significant for data sets with many dimensions but only a few strong features\n",
